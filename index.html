    <h2>Spray of the Game: How to Win Friends and Influence People</h2>
    <h3 class="text-muted byline">op-ed by <a href="#" >Tusen Takk</a></h3>
<h4>Today marks the kick-off of Overwatch's one year anniversary event, which is another holiday event complete with new items and loot boxes containing those items. 
  The game's officially been out a year, but I have been playing a long while before that in open beta, closed beta, alpha (was there an alpha?), so it's been a very long road.
    <br />
  The Anniversary Event has been something of a mystery, as Blizzard has not shown much from it, only a few skins, a couple arena maps and general thoughts about the year in review. 
  Unlike most past Overwatch events, it doesn't have a particular theme, and for the skins we saw ahead of today, the theme was pretty much just "cool skins."
  I've said that Overwatch needs to add more items to the permanent loot pool for this anniversary, but that does not seem to be happening. 
  As such, players have the usual three week window to try and get as many of the items as they can, and if they don't, well, I guess there's always next year.
  <blockquote class="blockquote bq-warning">
  <p class="bq-title">But as is tradition, instead of grinding out a bunch of boxes, I'll just be buying them. 
  <p>A hundred, exactly, as I normally do, and I will report what I get from them so you can check out your odds, 
  and what you might get if you decide to grind/shell out yourself.</p>
  </blockquote>
  I do not have a full accounting of what's in this event, so I expect to find a few surprises? Ready? <a href="#" >Let's go.</a>

    <h2><a href="#" >How the $#%~! can you call THIS Legendary?</a></h2>
	 <h3 class="text-muted byline">op-ed by <a href="#">Ben Smash</a></h3>
      <h4>I am not talking about the obviously good legendary's but the blatant confusion caused by some. The reason I am bringing this up is because i play tracer and just Tracer, 
  I love her as a character and I see how much work is put into her. 
  <br />
  She is beautiful, spunky, funny, and fun loving. She is the poster girl after all, but her two legendary's, the (Punk & Ultraviolet) skins are the thing that make no sense to me.
  It wasn't just her two skins but also Widowmaker's Odile/Odette along with Zarya's Cybergoth/Industrial Legendary's as well. 
  They are not poorly made by any means but they make no sense when compared to the hero's personality, story or even the legendary skins of other heroes. They seemed like someone just made them 
  because of a lack of any more clever ideas but I know blizzard and to me that seems improbable. Blizzard is really good at making characters, filling in the characters with a great story and 
  making those characters come to life, but this is exactly why I am confused.
  Almost every hero has a fantastic legendary skin from Bastion and D.va's steampunk to Zenyatta's Sunyatta legendary. They all had cultural, funny, or just plain cool skins. <br />
  
  But then there is the three hero's that are just (goth) and yea the look of that is distinct and eye popping and a small minority like it but, it doesn't meet any of the requirements that 
  the other heroes seem to have gotten. It doesn't show Tracers fun-loving, spunky character, it doesn't show Widowmakers' serious/killer personality and they don't help with Zarya's strong 
  revolutionary background. They are just "goth", no representation of anything, it is just these heroes in Goth/Punk fashion. There is no creativity behind them compared to other skins of either 
  other heroes or the same ones.
  
  <blockquote class="blockquote bq-info">
  At first I thought it was me but I asked around to other avid players and even some random people in the game and it seems 98% of people feel like these hero's just have gotten 
  fill in legendary skins.
  </blockquote>
  <br />
 Some people have liked them but for almost everyone this is the skins they pick
  <ul class="list-disc">
  <li>Tracer - Posh/Sport</li>
  <li>Widowmaker - Winter/Huntress</li>
  <li>Zarya - To be honest a lot of people didn't even care about her skins but if they had to it would be Arctic or Siberian front<br /> 
  (which are pretty much the same thing might i add.)</li>
  </ul>
Now before I get hasty rage reply's or down-voted to oblivion I would like to clarify a few points.
  <ul class="list-circle">
  <li> I don't want the current skins I am referring to go and get removed</li>
  <li> I don't think they are poorly made skins </li>
  <li> I know a few people like them </li>
  <li> I don't have anything against the style overall, I just don't think they fit </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Now I know that more skins will be on the way and they work very hard on their skin but I would like to know why these were picked. It doesn't have to be a good one, 
  you could say "John from design really likes the look" and I would be fine with that.</p> 
  I don't want to know out of anger by any means, it is just pure curiosity from a design perspective.
